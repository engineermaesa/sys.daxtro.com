Disclaimer: The listed directories above only contain files that were modified during Batch 9 Internship Program. Further documentation about other features are not listed, as they were horribly vibecoded by the former vendor and also NOT explored during The Woeful Intern (me)'s short stay in this dumpster fire of a company. Please tweak according to requirements given by the user. xoxo

2. Sales claims lead → Status: Cold
3. Meeting scheduled → Status remains Cold
4. Meeting completed successfully → Status: Warm
5. Follow-up activities → Status: Hot
6. Deal closed → Status: Deal
7. Inactive leads (10 days) → Auto-trash

### Meeting Flow
1. Sales schedules meeting (online/offline)
2. For offline: Submit expenses for approval
3. Finance reviews and approves/rejects
4. Meeting occurs
5. Sales records result (Success/Failed)
6. System updates lead status based on result

### Expense Flow
1. Sales schedules offline meeting
2. Enter expense details
3. Submit to finance (status: submitted)
4. Finance reviews
5. Approve → Sales can proceed
6. Reject → Sales revises and resubmits

return [
    'Jakarta Pusat',
    'Jakarta Utara',
    // ... more cities
];
```

### Auto-Trash Settings
Configure in `app/Services/AutoTrashService.php`:
```php
const INACTIVE_DAYS = 10; // Days before auto-trash
```

## Troubleshooting

## Development Notes

### Adding New Features

3. Create controller: `php artisan make:controller ControllerName`
4. Add routes in `routes/web.php`
5. Create views in `resources/views/`

* refer to Migration Not Working in Troubleshooting section.
